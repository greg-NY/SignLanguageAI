# SignLanguageAI - Rationale
This AI project translates sign language into text, helping mute individuals communicate more easily with others who donâ€™t understand sign language. It promotes inclusion and helps to break down communication barrier between the abled and the disabled.

## Process
Using Teachable Machine, this AI model was trained with a large dataset of handsigns representing letters. Once the program is active, it continuously takes in data from an input(feed) from a camera, or testing data, and identifies the letters and accurately forms the word with it. It then displays the message.

Sample Input(data comes from a teachable machine): ["I", "W", "O", "U", "L", "D", "L", "I", "K", "E","T", "O","G","E", "T", "T", "H", "E", "S", "U", "B", "W", "A", "Y", "M", "E", "L", "T"]


Sample Output to the user: "I would like to get the subway melt"
